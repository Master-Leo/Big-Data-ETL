# Big-Data-ETL
 
 ## Introduction
> Implemented various ETL techniques on Amazon's shoppers product reviews. A single dataset alone contained over 1.5 million rows with various 40 meta-data links. My goal was to perform ETL processing in the cloud and upload a structured DataFrame to an RDS instance. Second goal was to utilize PySpark and SQL to perform a statistical analysis on the selected data.
 
 - This mini-project is split into two sections: 
  1. Extract two Amazon customer review datasets, transforming into 4 final DataFrames        and loading onto AWS cloud. 
  2. Extract two Amazon review datasets and use SQL and PySpark to analyze whether            reviews from Amazon's Vine program are trustworth.
